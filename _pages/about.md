I am a first-year graduate student at University of California, Santa Barbara.

My research interests include real-time rendering and ray tracing.

I am also interested in game development.

Selected Experience
======
Research
------
From 2022 to 2024, I worked as a **Student Researcher** at Tsinghua University under the supervision of Prof. Kun Xu. I participated in research projects involving **image vectorization** and **subsurface scattering**.

Internships
------
In the summer of 2023, I worked as an Algorithm Strategy Intern in the Autocar Department of Meituan, where I worked on high-performance lidar occlusion data processing via **parallel BVH construction on GPU**.

In the fall of 2023, I worked as an intern in the Simulation & Research Department of Taichi Graphics, where I contributed to their cloud renderer, [Taitopia](https://taitopia.design/), adding features such as **volumetric rendering** and **photon mapping**.
